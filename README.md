🔮 PixelForge AI: Neural Image Architect
PixelForge AI is a decentralized, high-performance image generation suite built for creators. It leverages a global network of GPUs via the AI Horde to "forge" high-fidelity images across multiple neural styles and custom aspect ratios without requiring local GPU power.

🚀 Core Features
Decentralized Inference Engine: Powered by the AI Horde API, allowing for professional-grade generation on standard hardware like the HP Victus.

Neural Blueprinting: Real-time status badges for Style and Canvas Ratio appear immediately upon initiation.

Dynamic UI Architecture: A custom Streamlit frontend featuring persistent selection highlights and a dark-mode optimized "Enterprise" terminal.

Multi-Geometry Support: Native support for 1:1 (Square), 16:9 (Widescreen), and 9:16 (Portrait) aspect ratios.

Secure Data Handling: Integrated Negative Directives to filter out unwanted artifacts and low-quality results.

🛠️ The Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (Python-based UI Framework).

Backend Logic: Python requests library orchestrating asynchronous API handshakes.

External API: AI Horde (Decentralized GPU Cluster).

Data Handling: JSON-ready architecture for future user state persistence.

📖 How to Use
Input Vision: Enter your descriptive prompt in the "Neural Vision" field.

Define Exclusions: Use the "Negative Directive" to list elements the AI should avoid.

Set Geometry: Click a Canvas Ratio button to define your image dimensions.

Apply Theme: Select a Neural Theme (e.g., Cyberpunk, Anime, Cinematic).

Execute: Click INITIATE FORGE SEQUENCE and watch the system console for real-time updates.

📦 Installation & Local Setup
To run this project on your local machine (e.g., HP Victus), follow these steps:
